# Bohemia Kenya Data Pipeline
Author: atediarjo@gmail.com

## About
An end-to-end ETL tools used for Bohemia Kenya project. 

Existing Data workflows âžœ
1. ODK Form Extraction
2. Data Cleaning
3. Anomaly Identification

Each data processes above is represented as folders. Each folders will be configured with continuous integration process to our [DataBrew Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=databrewllc) using GitHub Actions. Each images stored in Dockerhub will then be captured by our [ETL Tool](https://github.com/databrew/ecs-data-workflow/tree/main) and deployed to our workflow in AWS.

## Contributing

### Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/databrew/bohemia-kenya-data-pipeline.git
```

### Create a feature branch
To make contribution to data workflow, start by creating a feature branch. 
```
git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```
*Preferred git branch naming convention: [email_handle]_[feature_name]*

### Understanding Folder Structure
Each folder is a microservice used for data orchestration. Each folder will have these 4 components:
```
|-- your-workflow-folder
        |-- renv.lock
        |-- Dockerfile
        |-- Makefile
        |-- R/
```
- `renv.lock`: This is the file used to create virtual environment in R. It snapshots your local session library and locks the library versioning to make sure full-reproducibility of data pipeline
- `Dockerfile`: This is the Dockerfile used for creating fresh container to run the data workflow. Docker is used to help deploy resources to fresh AWS instance
- `Makefile`: This file is a helper to streamline running R scripts (can be changed to .sh executable if needed)
- `R/`: This is where your Rscript lives

### Modifying Existing Workflow Folder

To modify existing foler, you can directly work inside the folder. Ideally, you would create an `.Rproj` on that folder to work in your local RStudio.

#### a. Reproducing Production R Environment using `Renv` in RStudio
Using this setting, your local R Environment will work in an isolated environment that resembles Production.

```R
install.packages("renv")
renv::init(bare = TRUE)
renv::restore()
```

#### b. Adding new library to `Renv` virtual environment
For every new libraries used, you will be required to record the changes to the `renv.lock`. Let's use installing R Lubridate for example:

```R
install.packages("lubridate")
renv::snapshot()
```

#### c. Adding new R scripts
To streamline running several R scripts, edit the `Makefile`/`bash` files and add the new R Scripts
